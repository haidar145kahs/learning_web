        "Atomic model" redirects here. For the unrelated term in mathematical logic, see atomic model (mathematical logic).
        This article is about the historical development of understanding the existence and behavior of atoms. For a history of the study of how atoms combine to form molecules, see history of molecular theory. For the modern view of the atom which developed from atomic theory, see atomic physics.
        Atomic theory is the scientific theory that matter is composed of particles called atoms. The concept that matter is composed of discrete particles is an ancient idea, but gained scientific credence in the 18th and 19th centuries when scientists found it could explain the behaviors of gases and how chemical elements reacted with each other. By the end of the 19th century, atomic theory had gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community.
        The term "atom" comes from the Greek word atomos, which means "uncuttable". John Dalton applied the term to the basic units of mass of the chemical elements under the mistaken belief that chemical atoms are the fundamental particles in nature; it was another century before scientists realized that Dalton's so-called atoms have an underlying structure of their own. Particles which are truly indivisible are now referred to as "elementary particles".
