                Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of 
                the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. 
                It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, 
                quantum field theory,quantum technology, and quantum information science.

            <h2>simple explanation : </h2>
            <p class="preface">
                Essentially, quantum mechanics is the study of how atomic particles exist and interact with each other.
                You might be familiar with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/47814-classical-mechanics.html" data-tool-tip=" read about it ">classical mechanics</a>, such as 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Newtons-laws-of-motion" data-tool-tip=" read about it ">Newton’s three laws of motion</a>.
                Classical mechanics allows scientists to make very accurate predictions for big objects. 
                But these predictions do not work as well when you look at objects on a smaller scale.
                This is where quantum mechanics comes in. It describes laws of energy on the scale of atoms. 
                The best way to understand quantum mechanics is through the history of its major discoveries.

                        Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist,
                        widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. 
                        Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity,

                2. Erwin Schrödinge
                    <details class="parag">
                        Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger ( 12 August 1887 – 4 January 1961), 
                        sometimes written as Schroedinger or Schrodinger, 
                        was a Nobel Prize-winning Austrian and naturalized Irish physicist who developed a number of fundamental results in quantum theory: 
                        the Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time.
                        In addition, he wrote many works on various aspects of physics: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, 
                        physics of dielectrics, colour theory, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, 
                        and he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory. In his book What Is Life? 
                        Schrödinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. 
                        He also paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient, and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics,
                        and religion. He also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology.
                        In popular culture, he is most known for his "Schrödinger's cat" thought experiment.
                        Spending most of his life as an academic with positions at various universities, Schrödinger, along with Paul Dirac,
                        won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his work on quantum mechanics, 
                        the same year he left Germany due to his opposition to Nazism. In his personal life, 
                        he lived with both his wife and his mistress which may have led to problems causing him to leave his position at Oxford. 
                        Subsequently, until 1938, he had a position in Graz, Austria, until the Nazi takeover when he fled, 
                        finally finding a long-term arrangement in Dublin where he remained until retirement in 1955. 
                        He died in Vienna of tuberculosis when he was 73.

                3. Niels Bohr
                    <details class="parag">
                        Niels Henrik David Bohr ( 7 October 1885 – 18 November 1962) was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.
                        Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, 
                        in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. 
                        Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid.
                        He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, 
                        like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.
                        Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, 
                        now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. 
                        Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein,
                         George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, 
                         which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. 
                         Later, the element bohrium was named after him.
                        During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from Nazism. After Denmark was occupied by the Germans, 
                        he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the German nuclear weapon project. 
                        In September 1943 word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, so he fled to Sweden. 
                        From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, 
                        and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, 
                        Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. 
                        He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.
